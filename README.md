# Sooky-assessment.

I am developing a small backend application that can generate and transmit an encrypted data stream over a socket. The application also listens to incoming data stream on a socket, decrypts and decodes it, and saves it to a time series database. Finally, the application transmits the saved data to a small frontend app. The backend services can be developed in any programming language, although Node JS is preferred. You can also use Go or any other language that you are comfortable with.

the server is running on port  localhost:3000
